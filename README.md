# sfdx-org-launcher

A simple GUI for managing SFDX ORGs.  Currently only support "traditional" orgs.  Will likely add scratch org configuration in the future.

Currently only packaged for osx... Will hopefully add other distro's in future.

## Features

- View list of authenticated orgs
  - login to org
  - quick search
- Authenticate new orgs
- Remove orgs
- fix orgs with expired tokens

## Setup

- Must have [sfdx-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sfdx-cli) installed.  Recommend using `npm -i sfdx-cli`
- download `.dmg` from release
- install
- run
- report issues ;)
